<h1>NYC Taxi Demand Forecasting</h1>
<p>This project focuses on forecasting daily ride demands for NYC's Yellow Taxi service, leveraging historical data provided by the city's Taxi & Limousine Commission. The goal is to predict demand trends, enabling better resource allocation and enhancing service reliability for both drivers and passengers.</p>

<h3>Business Benefits of Solving the Problem</h3>
<p>By accurately forecasting daily demand, taxi operators can optimize fleet deployment, reducing wait times for passengers and improving the allocation of rides. This not only enhances the user experience but also contributes to increased revenue and reduced operational costs for taxi services.</p>

<h3>My Approach</h3>
<p>The approach involves data preprocessing to handle inconsistencies and missing values, exploratory data analysis to identify demand patterns, and feature engineering to enrich the dataset. Advanced machine learning techniques, including time series analysis and regression models, are employed to predict daily ride demands. Model performance is rigorously evaluated using metrics such as RMSE and MAE to ensure predictive accuracy.</p>
